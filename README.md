Master thesis project for the M.Sc. in Physics of Complex Systems @ Politecnico di Torino

This master thesis focuses on developing an AI model designed to generate profitable investment strategies that outperform market benchmarks.
Specifically, the model constructs a portfolio of 500 US equities, determining optimal positions and allocations for each stock.
The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk and transaction costs.

This repo contains the code for my (Gerardo Castagno) master thesis in Physics of Complex Systems @ Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of Andrea Barral and Alessandro Sabatino (Intesa Sanpaolo).
